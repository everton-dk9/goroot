# Find Zeros of functions using goroot

this repository contains some algorithms to find the approximation to roots of
real functions. These algorithms are implemented in the Go programming language

the code also contains some adaptations for printing purposes.

`NOTE`: this is a simple and navy implementation for a computer science class, so
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.
